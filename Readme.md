# canvas raycaster
A simple raycasting example in Javascript I've made in 2017 using [Lode's tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html).

Wall texture is from <http://www.areyep.com/RIPandMCS-TextureLibrary.html>

`canvas.html` needs to be served from a webserver (node.js or python's SimpleHTTPServer will do), otherwise you will get a CORS error and the program won't run.
